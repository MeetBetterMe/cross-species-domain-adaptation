## Domain-adaptive Neural Networks Improve Cross-Species TF Binding Prediction

The goal of this project is to train neural networks to predict transcription factor binding in one species (mouse), and then assess the performance of these networks in a previously unseen species (human). The neural networks utilize architectures which include convolutional layers, recurrent layers, and domain adaptation with a gradient reversal layer. Some code is adapted from work by @DivyanshiSrivastava, and the gradient reversal layer implementation is modified from @michetonu (Michele Tonutti) at https://github.com/michetonu/gradient_reversal_keras_tf.
